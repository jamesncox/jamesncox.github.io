I wanted to talk about my support groups in Slack that I could not live without! I am very close to those who are in my first support group, and we talk about random life stuff as much as we talk about school and coding. I've also started to get to know some more of my fellow students and have created separate groups, which currently are a bit more formal, talking mainly about the labs and helping with curriculum. 

And without any of them, I'm not sure how I could have gotten this far in the program. I am grateful to have as many resources as possible. I would argue that is critical to reach out and connect with as many people as you can. 

Of course everyone is different, as well as our processes for learning and working. However, it's hard for me to imagine a scenario where, once graduated, I will be working on projects on my own. Therefore, not only are my support groups helpful and necessary now, it feels like practice for the "real world."

If you're reading this, going through one of the programs, and you haven't cultivated one or more small groups within your cohort, reach out to a couple people today. Make those connections! 

Whenever I feel burnt out, or completely lost, I can always count on my groups to give me a lift. It's also nice to see others sharing your similar frustrations and be able offer them words of support and comfort too. We praise each other's accomplishments, help where we can, and sometimes talk about Game of Thrones or Avengers theories...

I am thankful for my Flatiron friends and without them I don't think I'd be where I am today in the program!
